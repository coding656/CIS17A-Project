//FOREWORD: This is the initial draft for the pseudocode of this project. Any commits are not final.

//PURPOSE: For this project, a program for a resturant will be created. This program will be designed to guide customers
through a digital menu, where they can order food, see what they have ordered, and view the total bill before paying.

//CONCEPT AND DESIGN: A digital menu for an American restaurant will utilize modular programming, consisting of five subprograms seen
from the main menu. The main menu being displayed will have "Appetizers," "Entrees," "Sides," "Desserts," and "Beverages." Each of the
individual components will be assigned a number. By inputting a number, customers will be able to order the item that corresponds to
that number. Loops will be utilized to allow the customer to access the main menu as many times as they need to. An accumulator will add
the total amount due, with all calculations accounted for. The inputs for each item will be stored, and displayed along the main menu
in a section below it, stylized with ASCII art.
